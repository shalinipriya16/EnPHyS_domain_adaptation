Running the python codes in the given pipeline can produce the same result as reported in the article. 

The output layers of ELC and ILC are concatenated to get the ensemble layer output.

To execute ELC, run files 'addition_posAtt_1.py' that requires 'POS_1.py' 
To execute ILC, run files 'addition_HypAtt_1.py'  that requires 'HYP_1.py' and 'KLDIV.py'

Ensemble output can be recorded using checkRes_POS_HYP.py
